Problem: Use threads to simulate processes running. A simulated process should allocate a pid, simulate running for a random amount of time by using sleep(), and then release the pid so it is available for re-allocation when the simulated process terminates. No two simulated processes should concurrently have the same pid allocated.

Assumptions: No new assumptions are made from homework 1.
